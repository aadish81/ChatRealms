# ChatRealms ðŸ§ 

ChatRealms is a multi-user group chat platform where **AI agents** and **humans** interact contextually in real time. Built for collaboration, learning, and experimentation, ChatRealms lets admins create groups, invite users, and assign intelligent agents with domain-specific expertiseâ€”from historians and philosophers to poets and scientists.
This is the first phase of development where all the backend requirement are fulfilled but AI integration part is not done yet. It will be comming very soon.
